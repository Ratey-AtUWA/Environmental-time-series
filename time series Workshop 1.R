# Load the packages we need for specialized time series
# functions in R

library(zoo)
library(xts) # we'll include xts just so you know about it
library(forecast)
#
# (optional) make a better colour palette than the R default!

#### data input ####
# read the data into a data frame - this is how R often stores
# data - it's not the format we need but we'll use it for comparison

                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# do some checks of the data

str(soiltemp) # more detailed information about the R object ('str'=structure)
plot(soiltemp$Temp_15cm, type = "l", col = 7)
#
# we really want the data in a different type of R object!
# we use the 'zoo' package to read the data in as a time series
# this is of class 'zoo' which is much more flexible than the
# default time series object in R

# note that we specified how the date was specified in our data file,
# and the time zone. Our time column was column 1, so we tell R this too.

# do some quick checks of the new R object:

# sometimes we need to use another time series data format,
# xts (eXtended Time Series) which allows us to use more functions
#
# make an xts object from our zoo object:

soilT_xts <- as.xts(soilT_zoo)
summary(soilT_xts)

plot(soilT_xts, col = 6, lwd = 1) # just to check
#
#### Finding the trend ####
## 1. using a moving average ___________________
# create a new time series from a moving average for each 24h
# to remove daily periodicity using the zoo::rollmean function
periodicity(soilT_xts)
findfrequency(soilT_xts)

soilT_movAv <- rollmean(soilT_zoo, 24)
plot(soilT_movAv, lwd = 2) # just to check
#
# optionally add some other lines to this plot for comparison
lines(soilT_zoo, col=8) # original data
lines(rollmean(soilT_zoo, 12), col=2) # 12 h is incorrect periodicity
#
## 2. using a linear (regression) model ____________________
# create a linear model of the time series...
lm0 <- lm(coredata(soilT_zoo) ~ index(soilT_zoo))

# use a plot to look at the linear fit
plot(soilT_zoo, col = 8)
abline(lm0, col = 2)


#### isolating the periodicity ####

# To model the periodicity we need to understand the 
# autocorrelation structure of the time series. 
# First we can do this graphically:
#
# plot the autocorrelation function acf()
plot(acf(soilT_xts))
# what does this tell you about autocorrelation in 
# this time series?
#
# plot the partial autocorrelation function (pacf)
plot(pacf(soilT_xts))
# interpreting partial autocorrelations is more complicated -
# refer to Long & Teetor (2019, Section 14.15). Simplistically,
# partial autocorrelation allows us to identify which and
# how many autocorrelations will be needed to model the 
# time series data.
#
# use Box test for autocorrelation
# the null hypothesis is that no autocorrelation exists
# at any lag distance (so p <= 0.05 'rejects' null):
Box.test(soilT_xts)
#
# remember we made a linear model of the time series...
# ...the residuals can give us just the periodicity component
lm0 <- lm(coredata(soilT_xts) ~ index(soilT_xts))
#
# make a time series of the lm residuals
soilT_periodic <- zoo(resid(lm0), index(soilT_xts))
plot(soilT_movAv); abline(lm0, col = "coral") # just to check
#
# ...but there is an argument that the trend is shown better 
# by a moving average than by a linear model, so we can
# subtract the moving average from the original data to get 
# the periodicity:
soilT_periodic2 <- soilT_zoo - soilT_movAv
# plot, setting y axis limits to similar scale to original data:
plot(soilT_periodic2, ylim = c(-6 ,6))
#
#### (optional) look at the unexplained variation ####
soilT_err = soilT_zoo - (soilT_lmfit + soilT_periodic2)
plot(soilT_err, ylim = c(-6 ,6))
# 
# and plot everything to show the components
soilT_lmfit <- zoo(lm0$fitted.values, index(soilT_zoo))
plot(cbind(soilT_zoo,soilT_periodic2,soilT_movAv, soilT_err),
  main = "Time series decomposition:\nSoil temperature at 15 cm (\u00B0C)", 
     ylim = c(-3,22), cex.main = 1.5, yax.flip = TRUE, col = c(7,8,5,6))
# notes: we could also include soilT_lmfit
#        cbind is to combine columns;
#        \n inserts a line break into a text string;
#        \u followed by a 4-character code inserts a Unicode 
#           character (e.g. \u00B0 gives the degrees symbol);
#        yax.flip alternates vertical axis labels

#### modelling time series with ARIMA ####

# use output of auto.arima() to run arima

confint(am1)
#
# checking residuals is our best diagnostic tool...
#   1. residual plot (top) should look like white noise
#   2. residuals should not be autocorrelated (bottom left plot)
#       AND p-value from Ljung-Box test (R console) should be 
#       GREATER THAN 0.05 
#   3. residuals should be normally distributed 
#     (bottom right plot)
